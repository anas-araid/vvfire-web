### VVFire tech stacks:
- vvfire-web:
    - [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- vvfire-api:
    - [SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/)
- vvfire-app:
    - [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin)

The main functions are:
- Complete management system for planning, searching and tracking rescue teams during field searches for missing people.
    - Is also an alternative to expensive GPS trackers by using just smartphone localization system.
    - You can easily monitor the positions of rescue teams at any time, have a summary of searched sectors based on datetime or area etc.

Other functionalities still in development:
- Android and iOS app
    - Through your smartphone it will be possible to set your own availability and use your device as a gps tracker during search and rescue (SAR) operations.
- Photographic documentation
    - Having a report with photographic documentation attached, often is really useful when we need to reconstruct rescue operations, especially if it concerns old events.
